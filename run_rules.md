# Submission Rules

### Video Submission
#### Preservation
- Runs must be uploaded to a permanent storage. Twitch is not accepted, as footage could be deleted. Instead, we recommend these services:
	- YouTube
	- catbox.moe (maximum 200MB) or filegarden.com
	- Your preferred option, so long it's permanent, and is compliant with the remaining rules

#### Quality
- At minimum a stable 30 FPS, and a resolution of HD (720p). If the FPS is less than 30, or it's unstable, the run will be rejected. The same goes for an unreadable resolution.

#### Audio
- Game audio can be off while recording, either through the recorder itself, or game settings. 

#### Segmentation
- Footage has to be completed in one single recording. If your run was found to have been modified with more than one video, it will be rejected.

#### Setup
- Recording of the intro sequence or joining the game must be done. Individual level runs must record the transition from the previous level and to the next. This is required for the sake of consistency in timing.

#### Crossposting
- Posting two runs with the same footage in distinct categories is prohibited, and will have your run rejected. Regardless if you follow the rules of both categories.

#### Version
- As of current date (December 2025), the developers have stated they may or may not continue work on the game. But for the sake of future-proofing, any footage recorded in a game version not up-to-date with the leaderboard will be rejected.

### Breaks
#### Eligibility
- Due to the short length of the game, we feel it is right to forbid breaks. Our reasoning is that, at most, your run will be less than five minutes. Should you pause the recording, your run will be rejected.

# Roblox Rules

### Modification
#### Executors
- Injecting an executor into the process is forbidden. Should your run be inspected and found that any values are changed, it will be rejected and have you permanently banned from posting runs.

#### Fastflags
- Fastflags are allowed and must be done through our permitted clients (see [roblox_guide.html](https://lightwork-speedrunning.github.io/light-work-speedrunning/roblox_guide.html)). Due to recent changes, Roblox only allows safe fastflags, which can be helpful for performance.

### Gameplay
#### Keybinds
- The use of macros, turbo functions, or any tool that automates inputs is strictly forbidden. One physical key press must correspond to one in-game action. Key remapping that doesn't follow any of the rules stated earlier is permitted.

#### Frame Rate
- While we are unsure if this affects the game, runners should be aware that uncapped frame rates may or may not affect game physics. All frame rates are currently permitted on the same leaderboard, but this may be subject to change if a significant advantage is discovered.
