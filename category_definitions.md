# Definitions

#### Categories

- Any%: Complete the game as quickly as possible.

- Respawn: Trigger a death from an in-game source (not manual reset).

- All Braziers: Light every standard brazier in the game before lighting the final golden brazier.

- Least Braziers: Complete the game by lighting the fewest possible standard braziers.

#### Subcagetories

- Unrestricted: Any and all tactics, including glitches and exploits, are permitted to achieve the fastest time. This includes going out-of-bounds.

- Glitchless: The use of major glitches is banned. This specifically prohibits going out-of-bounds (clipping through walls, floors, or other level geometry).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The primary rule for Glitchless is "no out-of-bounds" due to the current underdeveloped state of the game. For other questionable techniques, the moderation team will make a final ruling. Techniques that are deemed to fundamentally break the game's intended path or puzzles may be banned. These rulings will be made public and documented.

# Timing

#### Standard
- Timing starts from the first keystroke and ends once the golden brazier has been lit and movement stopped. With the exceptions of the following.

#### Respawn
- Timed as standard, but ends from the first frame the fade-out death animation begins.

#### Individual Levels
- Timed as standard, but ends from the first frame the fade-in level transition ends, and the screen is fully black. Recording rules apply.
